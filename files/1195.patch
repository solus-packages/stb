Subject: [PATCH] Fix misleading indentation in stb_divide.h
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

With -Wmisleading-indentation (part of -Wall), gcc 11.2.1 warns:

  In file included from test_c_compilation.c:22:
  ../stb_divide.h: In function 'test':
  ../stb_divide.h:316:4: warning: this 'if' clause does not guard... [-Wmisleading-indentation]

        |    ^~

This commit moves each call to stbdiv_check(â€¦) to the following line to
make clear that it is unconditional and to resolve the warning.
